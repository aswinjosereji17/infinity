            Equitable access to safe and effective vaccines is critical to ending the <mark>COVID-19</mark> pandemic,
            so it is hugely encouraging to see so many vaccines proving and going into development.
            WHO is working tirelessly with partners to develop, manufacture and deploy safe and effective vaccines. 
            Safe and effective vaccines are a game-changing tool: but for the foreseeable future we must continue wearing masks,
            cleaning our hands, ensuring good ventilation indoors, physically distancing and avoiding crowds. 
            Being vaccinated does not mean that we can throw caution to the wind and put ourselves and others at risk,
            particularly because research is still ongoing into how much vaccines protect not only against
            disease but also against infection and transmission.

            <h3>Covid-19 vaccines licensed in India</h3>
            Two vaccines were granted emergency use authorization by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization 
            (CDSCO) in India, Covishield® (AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin®
             (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited). Sputnik - V has been granted EUA in the month of April 2021.
        </p2>

            <h3>Possible side effects</h3>
            COVID-19 vaccine will be introduced only when the safety is proven. As is true for other vaccines,
             the common side effects in some individuals could be mild fever, pain, etc. at the site of injection. 
             States have been asked to start making arrangements to deal with any COVID-19 vaccine-related side-effects 
             as one of the measures towards safe vaccine delivery among masses.
